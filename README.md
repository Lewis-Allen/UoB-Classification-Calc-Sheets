# University of Brighton - Degree Calc (README IN PROGRESS.)
Grade calculating spreadsheets. Find out your current grade to help you set aims to achieve the degree classification you want.

## Prerequisites 
Basic Excel knowledge will be required for any modifications to be made.

## Optional Modules
The forty credits can be spread across two-to-four modules in the final year. Three spreadsheets have been provided for different module configurations. (One twenty credit module and two ten credit modules etc).

## Personalizing 
These sheets are designed for third-year students in the year 2018/2019. This consisted of twenty credits of optional modules in the second year, and forty credits of optional modules in the third year.

These sheets by default assume each optional module has two assignments worth 50% each. This will unlikely be perfect for all cases and will need to be changed to suit any personal requirements.

e.g. In the case of a ten credit module only having a single assignment/exam worth the entire module:

| Optional 10 Credit Module Two | Assignment One | 50.00% | 4.17 |   | 0.00 | 0.00 |
|-------------------------------|----------------|--------|------|---|------|------|
|                               | Assignment Two | 50.00% | 4.17 |   | 0.00 | 0.00 |

would become:

| Optional 10 Credit Module Two | Assignment One | 100.00% | 4.17 |   | 0.00 | 0.00 |
|-------------------------------|----------------|---------|------|---|------|------|
